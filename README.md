**POWER BI – DAY 1**

**Overview of PBI**

**Important concepts:**

- Methods that can getData in PBI: Methods that can getData in PBI:

\+ File CSV/XLSX…

\+ Scrape data about the website (Can learn)

\+ Get data from the API (Can learn)

- ETL (EXTRACT, TRANSFORM, LOAD) is a process used in data warehousing and data integration. Extract data from various (/ˈver.i.əs/: đa dạng) sources (&lt;/sɔːrs/&gt;), transforming it into a suitable (phù hợp) format, and loading it into a target database or data warehouse. This process helps in consolidating (consolidate /kənˈsɑː.lə.deɪt/: Hợp nhất) data for analysis and reporting purposes. (purpose /ˈpɝː.pəs/ = aim = target: Mục đích)

- Differences when using Filter with EXCEL and PBI:

\+ Excel: After using the filter, the filtered data will disappear /ˌdɪs.əˈpɪr/ (Be gone: Mất tiêu lun).

**POWER BI – DAY 3**

**DATA MODEL (Star schema)**

**Important concepts:**

- Relationship and Keys (Primary Key and Foreign Key)

\+ Normally, table has a single primary key, but it's also possible to have more than one (Uncommon).

\+ UUID (Universally unique identifier /aɪˈdentɪfaɪər/) (128-bit) provides a huge range (Almost infinite /ˈɪn.fə.nət/ range), while INT (32-bit) supports values (~ 2 bilion)

\+ In this data model, 'Data' is the Fact table, and 'Lookup' is the Dimension table.

- Here’s the structure: Fact_Survey is our Fact table, and Dim_AgeGroup and Dim_Location are Dimension tables used for lookups.
